The NTH Enclosure

The enclosure was cut using 1/8" acrylic.

The enclosure file was created in Adobe Illustrator CS4.  There are two layers:

Engraving:  This layer contains all of the etched elements on the NTH.
Cut:  This layer contains the actual cuts of the enclosure.  

We used a 65 watt Epilog Laser.  The settings we used are as follows:

Raster (etch) setting:  speed 100, power 40, air assist off
Vector (cut) setting:  speed 20, power 100, frequency 5000, air assist off
